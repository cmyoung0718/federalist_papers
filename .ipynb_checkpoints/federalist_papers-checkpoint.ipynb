       "u\" The Federalist 5    The Same Subject Continued  (Concerning Dangers From Foreign Force and Influence)  Jay for the Independent Journal.    To the People of the State of New York:  QUEEN ANNE, in her letter of the 1st July, 1706, to the Scotch   Parliament, makes some observations on the importance of the UNION   then forming between England and Scotland, which merit our attention.   I shall present the public with one or two extracts from it: ``An   entire and perfect union will be the solid foundation of lasting   peace: It will secure your religion, liberty, and property; remove   the animosities amongst yourselves, and the jealousies and   differences betwixt our two kingdoms. It must increase your   strength, riches, and trade; and by this union the whole island,   being joined in affection and free from all apprehensions of   different interest, will be enabled to resist all its enemies.''   ``We most earnestly recommend to you calmness and unanimity in this   great and weighty affair, that the union may be brought to a happy   conclusion, being the only effectual way to secure our present and   future happiness, and disappoint the designs of our and your   enemies, who will doubtless, on this occasion, use their utmost   endeavors to prevent or delay this union.''  It was remarked in the preceding paper, that weakness and   divisions at home would invite dangers from abroad; and that   nothing would tend more to secure us from them than union, strength,   and good government within ourselves. This subject is copious and   cannot easily be exhausted.  The history of Great Britain is the one with which we are in   general the best acquainted, and it gives us many useful lessons.   We may profit by their experience without paying the price which it   cost them. Although it seems obvious to common sense that the   people of such an island should be but one nation, yet we find that   they were for ages divided into three, and that those three were   almost constantly embroiled in quarrels and wars with one another.   Notwithstanding their true interest with respect to the continental   nations was really the same, yet by the arts and policy and   practices of those nations, their mutual jealousies were perpetually   kept inflamed, and for a long series of years they were far more   inconvenient and troublesome than they were useful and assisting to   each other.  Should the people of America divide themselves into three or   four nations, would not the same thing happen? Would not similar   jealousies arise, and be in like manner cherished? Instead of their   being ``joined in affection'' and free from all apprehension of   different ``interests,'' envy and jealousy would soon extinguish   confidence and affection, and the partial interests of each   confederacy, instead of the general interests of all America, would   be the only objects of their policy and pursuits. Hence, like most   other bordering nations, they would always be either involved in   disputes and war, or live in the constant apprehension of them.  The most sanguine advocates for three or four confederacies   cannot reasonably suppose that they would long remain exactly on an   equal footing in point of strength, even if it was possible to form   them so at first; but, admitting that to be practicable, yet what   human contrivance can secure the continuance of such equality?   Independent of those local circumstances which tend to beget and   increase power in one part and to impede its progress in another, we   must advert to the effects of that superior policy and good   management which would probably distinguish the government of one   above the rest, and by which their relative equality in strength and   consideration would be destroyed. For it cannot be presumed that   the same degree of sound policy, prudence, and foresight would   uniformly be observed by each of these confederacies for a long   succession of years.  Whenever, and from whatever causes, it might happen, and happen   it would, that any one of these nations or confederacies should rise   on the scale of political importance much above the degree of her   neighbors, that moment would those neighbors behold her with envy   and with fear. Both those passions would lead them to countenance,   if not to promote, whatever might promise to diminish her   importance; and would also restrain them from measures calculated   to advance or even to secure her prosperity. Much time would not be   necessary to enable her to discern these unfriendly dispositions.   She would soon begin, not only to lose confidence in her neighbors,   but also to feel a disposition equally unfavorable to them.   Distrust naturally creates distrust, and by nothing is good-will   and kind conduct more speedily changed than by invidious jealousies   and uncandid imputations, whether expressed or implied.  The North is generally the region of strength, and many local   circumstances render it probable that the most Northern of the   proposed confederacies would, at a period not very distant, be   unquestionably more formidable than any of the others. No sooner   would this become evident than the northern hive would excite the   same ideas and sensations in the more southern parts of America   which it formerly did in the southern parts of Europe. Nor does it   appear to be a rash conjecture that its young swarms might often be   tempted to gather honey in the more blooming fields and milder air   of their luxurious and more delicate neighbors.  They who well consider the history of similar divisions and   confederacies will find abundant reason to apprehend that those in   contemplation would in no other sense be neighbors than as they   would be borderers; that they would neither love nor trust one   another, but on the contrary would be a prey to discord, jealousy,   and mutual injuries; in short, that they would place us exactly in   the situations in which some nations doubtless wish to see us, viz.,   formidable only to each other.  From these considerations it appears that those gentlemen are   greatly mistaken who suppose that alliances offensive and defensive   might be formed between these confederacies, and would produce that   combination and union of wills of arms and of resources, which would   be necessary to put and keep them in a formidable state of defense   against foreign enemies.  When did the independent states, into which Britain and Spain   were formerly divided, combine in such alliance, or unite their   forces against a foreign enemy? The proposed confederacies will be   distinct nations. Each of them would have its commerce with   foreigners to regulate by distinct treaties; and as their   productions and commodities are different and proper for different   markets, so would those treaties be essentially different.   Different commercial concerns must create different interests, and   of course different degrees of political attachment to and   connection with different foreign nations. Hence it might and   probably would happen that the foreign nation with whom the southern   confederacy might be at war would be the one with whom the northern   confederacy would be the most desirous of preserving peace and   friendship. An alliance so contrary to their immediate interest   would not therefore be easy to form, nor, if formed, would it be   observed and fulfilled with perfect good faith.  Nay, it is far more probable that in America, as in Europe,   neighboring nations, acting under the impulse of opposite interests   and unfriendly passions, would frequently be found taking different   sides. Considering our distance from Europe, it would be more   natural for these confederacies to apprehend danger from one another   than from distant nations, and therefore that each of them should be   more desirous to guard against the others by the aid of foreign   alliances, than to guard against foreign dangers by alliances   between themselves. And here let us not forget how much more easy   it is to receive foreign fleets into our ports, and foreign armies   into our country, than it is to persuade or compel them to depart.   How many conquests did the Romans and others make in the characters   of allies, and what innovations did they under the same character   introduce into the governments of those whom they pretended to   protect.  Let candid men judge, then, whether the division of America into   any given number of independent sovereignties would tend to secure   us against the hostilities and improper interference of foreign   nations. Publius.   <previous - next> <previous - next> \""

Both New  York and Virginia delegates were sharply divided in their  opinions of the Constitution. And New York governor George  Clinton had already made clear his opposition.       One would imagine that a work so highly praised and so  influential as The Federalist Papers was the ripe fruit of a long  lifetime's experience in scholarship and government. In fact, it  was largely the product of two young men: Alexander  Hamilton of New York, age 32, and James Madison of Virginia, age  36, who wrote in great haste-sometimes as many as four  essays in a single week.
